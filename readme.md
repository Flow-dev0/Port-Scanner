# PortScanner
### Simple  port scanner that stores a list of open ports in json file

## How to use
Enter the IP address in the "target_connection.config" file and then simply run the python script. Upon completion a file named "open_ports.json" will be generated in the current directory.

## Windows 
`python fastscan.py`

## Linux

**Plan to add the ability to scan more than one IP address**
